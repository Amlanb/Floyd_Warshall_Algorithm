# Key Conclusions from the Analysis:

# Network Density:
The airport network has a low density of 0.015, indicating that only about 1.5% of all possible airport connections exist. This suggests a sparse network with many airports not directly connected.

# Clustering Coefficient:
The average clustering coefficient is 0.576, meaning that airports tend to form local clusters where direct neighbors are also interconnected. This implies regional hubs or country-based connectivity.

# Central Airports (Most Connected):
The central airports should ideally have the shortest average shortest path to all other airports. However, the results show infinity (inf) values, which suggests that the network is disconnected, and many airports do not have a path to all others.

# Isolated Airports:
The same set of airports appears under "Most Isolated Airports," again with inf values, confirming that they are not connected to the network properly. This might be due to an issue in defining connections or an overly strict distance threshold.

# Next Steps:
# Fix the Connectivity Issue:
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm requires a fully connected graph. If some airports are unreachable, they should be connected through realistic airline routes or by adjusting the distance threshold.

# Verify Distance Threshold:
The 500 km threshold for defining an edge might be too small, leading to disconnected components. Consider increasing it to 1000 km or using real flight route data.

# Re-run the Analysis:
After fixing the connectivity, re-evaluate the centrality measures to identify truly central and isolated airports.
