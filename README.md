# Key Conclusions from the Analysis:

# Network Density:
The airport network has a low density of 0.015, indicating that only about 1.5% of all possible airport connections exist. This suggests a sparse network with many airports not directly connected.

# Clustering Coefficient:
The average clustering coefficient is 0.576, meaning that airports tend to form local clusters where direct neighbors are also interconnected. This implies regional hubs or country-based connectivity.

# Central Airports (Most Connected):
The central airports should ideally have the shortest average shortest path to all other airports. However, the results show infinity (inf) values, which suggests that the network is disconnected, and many airports do not have a path to all others.

# Isolated Airports:
The same set of airports appears under "Most Isolated Airports," again with inf values, confirming that they are not connected to the network properly. This might be due to an issue in defining connections or an overly strict distance threshold.
